			Some features let you decide where code will be placed 
			using a target picker. The target picker looks like this:

			![](TargetPicker;;;0.03,0.03)

			The horizontal line specifies where the new code will go. 

			Move the target picker up or down with the Up/Down arrows and 
			press Enter to accept the targeted location.

			Escape cancels.

			Refactorings that use the Target Picker will also drop a Marker
			at the location where you started so you can get back quickly.

			![](BtnMarkers;crcommand:OpenFile:Markers.cs;;0.03,0.03)  << Learn about Markers.
