		Some CodeRush features create code in *new locations* (and take you 
		there so you can see the new code). 

		Before shifting the view, CodeRush drops a marker so you can return 
		to where you were.

		CodeRush markers look like this: ![](Marker;;;0.03,0.03)

		To get back to the dropped marker, press Escape (or Alt+End).
