//`++Welcome to the Learning CodeRush Solution!
/*
This project contains source files and examples to help you learn CodeRush 
features, as well as shortcuts to invoke them.

To start the first lesson, click below:

	![](BtnCapsSpaceTrim;crcommand:OpenFile:CapsSpace.cs;;0.04,0.04) << Caps+Space to toggle code


Or for a lesson overview:

	![](BtnAllLessons;crcommand:OpenFile:AllLessonsCapsModifier.cs;;0.03,0.03) << in this project


While examples in this project show how to **instantly** refactor code, all 
refactorings can be accessed with Visual Studio's Code Action menu (use 
Ctrl+. or Num 0).                                                            */
